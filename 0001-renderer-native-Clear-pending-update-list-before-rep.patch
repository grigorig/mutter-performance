Subject: [PATCH] renderer/native: Clear pending update list before
 repopulating

Before we did a simple copy, meaning the old list was overriden. Copy
was too eager, as it meant views without modes to set was waited for,
resulting in a dead lock. Instead only the relevant views were added to
the list for view which had pending updates needed. What was missed was
that the list was never cleared, meaning we just appended the new list
on top of the old, causing issues.
